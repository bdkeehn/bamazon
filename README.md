In this app you will be able to use My SQL to create a database of products on bamazon.  Once the application is run, a table will appear of all of the products and their quantities and id #'s. It currently provides a visual for the client as to how much of each product is available. 
The user can select from the 10 items and request to buy a certain quanitity.
Future developments are to get the prompts working for when there is not enough of a prticular item in stok.

Languages used were JS and My SQL.
